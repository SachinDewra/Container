		<section>Premchand was born on 31 July 1880 in Lamhi, a village located near Varanasi (Banaras). His ancestors came from a large Kayastha family, which owned six bighas of land.[3] His grandfather Guru Sahai Rai was a patwari (village accountant), and his father Ajaib Rai was a post office clerk. His mother was Anandi Devi of Karauni village, who could have been the inspiration for the character Anandi in his Bade Ghar Ki Beti.[4] Premchand was the fourth child of Ajaib Lal and Anandi; the first two were girls who died as infants, and the third one was a girl named Suggi.[5] His parents named him Dhanpat Rai ("the master of wealth"), while his uncle, Mahabir, a rich landowner, nicknamed him "Nawab" ("Prince"). "Nawab Rai" was the first pen name chosen by Premchand.[6]</section>
